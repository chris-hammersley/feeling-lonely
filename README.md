This is an interactive video chat roulette-type simulation that will be used for an upcoming indie film.

Viewer spins a wheel to determine which person is ready for a video chat. Agreeing to chat opens 2 video windows which start to play. You're basically a voyeur as you get to know the characters in the film.
